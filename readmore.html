    <h2>🌸 My Story</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Daniel-Ukpoju Ochanya Faith — You can call me Gentleme🌸. I’m a proud third-year Computer Science student at the University of Abuja.  
      I have a deep passion for programming because I believe technology has the power to change lives and solve real-world problems.  
    </p>

    <p>
      But I’m not just about computers and code. I also love cooking and dream of becoming a professional chef one day 🍳. 
      For me, cooking is a way of spreading love, joy, and comfort. Another big part of my heart is giving back — I dream of becoming a philanthropist and building a <strong>free healthcare center</strong> for my community. 
      I want a world where everyone — rich or poor — can receive medical attention without worrying about money.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up wasn’t easy. Life has been tough, but those challenges shaped me into who I am today.  
      I know what it feels like to struggle, and that’s why I want children and the less privileged to know this truth:  
      <em>“You are not alone. Your voice matters. You can rise and be heard.”</em>  
    </p>

    <p>
      With programming, I’ve already started solving problems. At my school, students often struggle to get access to learning materials.  
      To help, I developed a <strong>Material Portal</strong> — a website where students can log in and download resources easily for free without paying a dime.  
      It’s not live yet because I need funds to host it properly, but I’m determined to make it a reality soon.  
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just the beginning of my journey. I want to build, create, and inspire. Whether through code, food, or kindness,  
      my goal is simple: <strong>to leave this world better than I found it</strong>. 🌍✨
    </p>
